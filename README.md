#Usage (more info in [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/ws2016lab/wiki) )

 [Download](https://github.com/Microsoft/ws2016lab/raw/master/scripts.zip) scripts and [Windows Server 2016 TP5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview) 
 
 > Note: please [download](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB3157663) Cumulative Update for Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 KB3157663 and add it to OSServer\Packages after 1_Prereq.ps1
 
 Unzip scripts in some folder
 
 Right-click and run with PowerShell. (1_Prereq.ps1 -> 2_CreateParentDisks.ps1 -> 3_Deploy.ps1 -> Cleanup.ps1 (if needed) -> modify variables.ps1 -> 3_Deploy.ps1 again)

 You will be prompted for Windows Server 2016 ISO (TP5 and newer only) when running 2_CreateParentDisks.ps1. 

 You can create [multiple scenarios](https://github.com/Microsoft/ws2016lab/wiki/variables.ps1-examples) if you modify variables.ps1 - **Simple**, **S2D** works on Windows 10
 **Replica**, **Shared** requires Failover Clustering (svhdx filter driver)

#What's in the lab

Automatically hydrated Domain Controller with DHCP and one scope. There are several accounts automatically provisioned - SQL Run As Account, SQL Agent Account,  VMM Service Account and one additional Domain Admin with name you can specify, so you can install SQL + SC VMM easily.

You can then modify variables.ps1 to hydrate whatever you want. Like this 4 node nano s2d cluster with 200TB capacity - all running on ultrabook.

#So what is it good for?

Simulations such as
* how to script against nano servers
* how to automate configuration
* what will happen when I run this and that command
* how change drive in S2D cluster
* what will happen when one node goes down
* testing new features before pushing to production
* ...
